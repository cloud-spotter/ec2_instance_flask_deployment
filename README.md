# AWS EC2 Instance Flask App Deployment

A simple Python/Flask app created for a Cloud Engineering course exercise. The objective was to deploy a containerised Flask app to an AWS EC2 instance and the focus was researching what the process involved in this required, and developing a workflow to achieve the objective. 

The app displays a diagram of the workflow and the main environments where actions needed to be taken.
